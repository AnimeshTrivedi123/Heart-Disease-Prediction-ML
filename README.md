# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML
![Heart Disease logo](Img(Heart Disease.png)
## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical attributes. The model is built using Python-based machine learning and data science libraries.

## Project Approach
We follow the below methodology:
1. **Problem Definition**: Predict heart disease based on patient medical parameters.
2. **Data Source**: 
   - Cleveland dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
   - Also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
3. **Evaluation Metric**: The goal is to achieve at least **95% accuracy** in prediction.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Selection and transformation of relevant features.
5. **Modeling**: Applying machine learning models for prediction.
6. **Experimentation**: Tuning models to optimize accuracy.
